Book Descriptions:
I was supposed to have it all.

I‚Äôd been Prom Queen, Cheer Captain - high school‚Äôs most savage Queen Bee. I could have everything I wanted.
Except them. The freaks, the weirdos, the school‚Äôs ultimate losers: Manson, Jason, Lucas, and Vincent. Our hatred for each other couldn‚Äôt keep us apart, not even when my own mistake got Manson expelled and made me the ultimate villain to the rest of them.

One night was supposed to be enough.

I couldn‚Äôt resist forever. For one night I gave myself over to the men I wasn‚Äôt supposed to want and satisfied the darkest parts of my soul. But some things are meant to stay in the dark. One night, and it was over.

Nothing more than a game.

Now, with college behind me, our worlds collide yet again. Four men, all willing to share me as their plaything until my debt to them is paid. Another game to satiate my dark cravings, the twisted rules of which bring us all even closer than before. But games aren‚Äôt meant to last.

When the debt is paid and the game is done, what if I don‚Äôt want to walk away?

Although not required, it is recommended to read the novella, The Dare, prior to reading Losers.
